    Welcome to the academic page of Dr. Zhaowei Yu. 
    My research explores the mechanistic foundations and implications of transcriptional regulatory dynamics that influence cell fate determination. 
    Over the past five years, I have concentrated on analyzing the complex co-association patterns of transcription regulators within distinct biological contexts, utilizing in-depth data analysis and advanced computational modeling. 
    More recently, I have begun developing <strong>contextual AI models</strong> that provides fundamental basis for a <strong>comprehensive understanding and synthesis of complex transcription regulatory systems</strong> in cells.
