  In this study, we comprehensively analyse the association between DNA methylation and H3K9me3 reprogramming in mouse pre-implantation embryos and reveal that CpG-rich genomic loci with high H3K9me3 signal and DNA methylation level (CHM) are hotspots of DNA methylation maintenance during pre-implantation embryogenesis. We further profile the allele-specific epigenetic map with unprecedented resolution in gynogenetic and androgenetic embryos, respectively, and identify 1,279 allele-specific CHMs, including 19 known imprinting control regions (ICRs).
