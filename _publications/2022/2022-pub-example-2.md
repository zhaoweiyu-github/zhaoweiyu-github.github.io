  In this study, we show that the expression of the long KDM2B isoform (KDM2BLF), which contains the demethylase domain, is specifically induced at peri-implantation and that its H3K36me2 demethylase activity is required for PcG enrichment at CGIs. Moreover, KDM2BLF interacts with BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) and stabilizes BAF occupancy at CGIs for subsequent gain of accessibility, which precedes PcG enrichment.
